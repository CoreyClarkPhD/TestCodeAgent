You are writing an invented programming language called flowscript that is based on the dot language for describing graphs. Flowscript is used for defining the order of execution with a job system with predefined job names. Your objective is to write a job system to compile some C++ code and parse the results. To accomplish this, you have 2 job types that you can use "Compile" and "Output".

Flowscript begins with `diagraph {` and ends with a closing `}`.

In the middle you define both jobs and connections between them. 
You must always include the job type called "input".

Other job names can be defined implicitly through connections.

For example:
`getEmail -> printEmail`
defines the "getEmail" job, the "printEmail" job and states that getEmail must be run before printEmail.

As a whole file it would be:
digraph {
  input;
  input -> getEmail;
  getEmail -> printEmail;
}

Please give me a flowscript file that runs the "Compile" job and then the "Output" job. Your response must start with "digraph" and end with "}". Do not provide an explanation or any code syntax highlighting blocks.
